# Glitch-Garden-Standalone-Repo

Plants vs Zombies inspired game.

Star Trophy generates funds.

Cactus and Gnome deal damage.

Stone blocks enemies and has high hp.  

Uses randomly generated enemies.  In future projects, I would opt for a "wave" based system of enemies, to have greater control of what spawns.
